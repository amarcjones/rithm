1. Where else have you seen 'asynchronous' code before? Think back to a certain section in Part I of the Intermediate JavaScript course.
We saw asynchronous code in the section on timers, when using callbacks (callbacks enable us to manage asynchronous code).

2. What is XHR?
XMLHttpRequest is an API that allows for transferring data between client and server.  You use the XHR object in JavaScript to communicate with a server and send/retireve data.

3. What is XML? Why do we prefer to use JSON?
Extensible Markup language is primarily used to store text data.  It looks similar to HTML, but in XML you can create you own tags.

4. What is AJAX?
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a set of technologies that allow for building single page applications because the apps don't require a full page refresh to change data on the page.  

5. Using the XHR object, make a request to https://omdbapi.com and choose a title to search by using the query string and key of t.
XHR.open("GET", "https://omdbapi.com?t=terminator");
XHR.send();

6. Using the fetch API, make a request to https://omdbapi.com and choose a title to search by using the query string and key of t.
fetch('https://omdbapi.com?t=terminator').then(function(response){
    return response.json().then(function(data){
        console.log(data);
    });
});
